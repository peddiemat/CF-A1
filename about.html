		<p id="bio">I started theatre when I was in the fourth grade.  My teacher wrote short plays and we would perform them for the rest of the school in the cafeteria.  I enjoyed performing; however, there was something missing. I would alway notice people working, but I had no clue what they were doing. It was not until the eighth grade that I figured out what they were doing. It was at that point I found my calling. 
		<br> <br>
		<br>I am a graduate of the <a href="https://www.cccepa.com" id="CCCEPA" target="_blank">Cobb County Center for Excellence in the Performing Arts</a> at Pebblebrook High School with a major in Technical Theatre. I work around the greater Atlanta area as a freelance Master Electrician and Lighting Designer. I recently received my membership card for I.A.T.S.E. Local 927. I work on a variety of different projects with the Atlanta Lyric and other theatreâ€™s including Lighting Programmer for Atlanta Opera. Most recently, I have been touring as a Head Electrician
